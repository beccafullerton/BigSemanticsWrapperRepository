The cataloguer displays all the tags, unique attributes, and the locations thereof of all metadata wrappers!
Just run /src/RepositoryCataloguer as you would any Java application :)

Results are stored in a nifty format in repositoryCatalogue.txt and as pure, pesticide-free JSON in repositoryCatalogueJSON.txt 
in this program's root directory.
